**Description**
  This Python script automates the process of solving LeetCode problems using web automation and the Claude AI API. It navigates through LeetCode's problem set, selects problems, generates solutions using Claude AI, and submits them automatically.

**Features**
  Automated login to LeetCode
  Navigation through LeetCode's problem set
  Problem selection based on availability and difficulty
  Code generation using Claude AI
  Automated code submission and error handling
  Retries with improved solutions on failures

**Requirements**
  Python 3.x
  Selenium WebDriver
  undetected_chromedriver
  anthropic Python library
  BeautifulSoup4

**Setup**

_Install required Python packages:_  
  
  pip install selenium undetected_chromedriver anthropic beautifulsoup4

_Set up your LeetCode credentials:_
  
  Update LEETCODE_USERNAME and LEETCODE_PASSWORD in the script with your LeetCode credentials.
_Set up Claude API:_
  
  Obtain an API key from Anthropic
  
  Replace API_KEY in the script with your actual API key

**Usage**
Run the script using Python:
  CD to wherever you have the file stored.
  python Solver.py

**The script will automatically:**
  Log in to LeetCode
  Navigate through problems
  Select a problem
  Generate a solution using Claude's 3.5 Sonnet API AI
  Submit the solution
  Handle any errors and retry if necessary
  Move on to the next problem

**Configuration**
You can modify the following constants in the script to adjust its behavior:
  MAX_RETRIES: Maximum number of attempts for each problem (1 = no retries, 2 = 1 retry, etc..)
  LEETCODE_PROBLEMSET_URL: Starting URL for problem navigation.
  CLAUDE_MODEL: The Claude AI model to use.
  MAX_TOKENS: Maximum tokens for Claude API responses.
  TEMPERATURE: Temperature setting for Claude API.

**Notes**
This is an example of how ‘real-language programming’ has become a modern viability. This project was built using real-language submitted to an AI, to build a code-based tool, that writes code solutions.

Building a system that can solve a massive amount of problems much faster than a normal person is valuable. The ability to sit infront of a blank script, or pseudocode structure, or designed system diagram, and write code using syntax from memory.. was not how I built this.

My code itself, and the code produced by Claude’s AI that successfully ‘solved’ the leetcode problems, is not the most reliable, readable, fastest, memory efficient, or scalable. However, this is a system that will get better at those priorities as AI systems will improve, therefore I consider building the meta-system the highest value-add behavior if not focusing on improving the underlying AI system.

I do believe that regardless of the current imperfect or non-optimal code generated by AI systems, there are plenty of instances of requirements or value propositions out there which would be best solved by a system that utilizes the power of AI systems to solve it, rather than humans hard-coding. At the very least, partner programming with an AI is called for.
